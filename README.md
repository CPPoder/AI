There are two species: Herbivores and Carnivores.
Herbivores eat randomly spawning food.
Carnivores eat Herbivores.

Their fertility decreases when they are hungry and increases when they are not.
When two of the same species have full fertility and meet, they create a child with a mixed genome.

Over some generations they learn how to find food. Herbivores start to show collective behaviour and avoid beeing eaten. Carnivores learn to hunt their prey, the Herbivores.
